# CI

[Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) is configured for this repository. Several tests and checks are started for
all pull requests:

* Unit tests that use the standard tool `go test`.
* `go fmt` tool to check code formatting. That tool is run with `-s` flag to
  perform [following
  transformations](https://golang.org/cmd/gofmt/#hdr-The_simplify_command).
* `go vet` to report likely mistakes in source code, for example suspicious
  constructs, such as `Printf` calls whose arguments do not align with the
  format string.
* `golint` as a linter for all Go sources stored in this repository.
* `gocyclo` to report all functions and methods with too high cyclomatic
  complexity. The cyclomatic complexity of a function is calculated according to
  the following rules: 1 is the base complexity of a function +1 for each `if`,
  `for`, `case`, `&&` or `||` Go Report Card warns on functions with cyclomatic
  complexity > 9.
* `goconst` to find repeated strings that could be replaced by a constant.
* `gosec` to inspect source code for security problems by scanning the Go AST.
* `ineffassign` to detect and print all ineffectual assignments in Go code.
* `errcheck` for checking for all unchecked errors in go programs.
* `shellcheck` to perform static analysis for all shell scripts used in this
  repository.
* `abcgo` to measure ABC metrics for Go source code and check if the metrics
  does not exceed specified threshold.

Please note that all checks mentioned above have to pass for the change to be merged into master branch.

History of checks performed by CI is available at [RedHatInsights / insights-content-service](https://travis-ci.org/RedHatInsights/insights-content-service).
