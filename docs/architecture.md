# Architecture

Content Service consists of three main parts:

1. A rules content parsing that reads the rules metadata from the defined repository, creating data
   structures.
1. A group configuration parser that reads a groups configuration file.
1. HTTP or HTTPS server that exposes REST API endpoints that can be used to read a single rule
   metadata content, a list of groups and a list of tags that belongs to a group.
